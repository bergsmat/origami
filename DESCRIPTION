Description: Defines a compact data format that includes metadata. 
 The function fold() creates the format by converting 
 from data.frame, and unfold() converts back. The predictability
 of the folded format supports reusability of data processing tools,
 while the presence of embedded metadata improves portability, 
 interpretability, and efficiency.
